          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>Do you ever feel that you've been dealt a dud hand when it comes to your health?  Or are you smugly sipping on your green juice, confident that it is giving you a direct line to Apollo, the god of eternal youth and the original source of health and healing? A recent study into the relationships between social factors and health risks has shown that our health outcomes are dependent on our social circumstances.</p>

          <p>Money might not buy you love, but it can buy you health.  People with higher incomes are less likely to smoke, less likely to be obese and more likely to have healthcare.  People living in poverty are more likely to smoke, more likely to be obese and less likely to have healthcare.</p>

          <p>It seems that we are more likely to make positive health choices as we age, with smoking rates decreasing with age, and healthcare plans increasing with age.  The correlation between age and obesity is less clear.</p>

          <p>The data for this study was taken from US Census Bureau and the Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System, for 2014.</p>
